        <p>Let's play a game where we're trying to guard an art gallery from thieves. We want to place as few guards as possible but have the guards
        be able to see the whole gallery.</p>
        <p>The art in our gallery is on the walls, so the guards must be able to see the entirety of every edge of the gallery. If a guard can see both vertices for a given edge,
        he can see the whole edge.</p>
        <p>Click in the gallery to place a guard, click and drag existing guards to move them, and drag guards out of the gallery to delete them.</p>
        <p>Guards that you place will draw lines to all three corners of the gallery. No matter where you place a guard
            in a triangular gallery, he will be able to see the whole gallery. This is because triangles are CONVEX polygons.</p>
